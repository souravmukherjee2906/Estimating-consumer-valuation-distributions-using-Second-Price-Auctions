- This repository contains codes for the finished project "A Non-Parametric Approach for Estimating Consumer Valuation Distributions Using Second Price Auctions".
- Abstract: We focus on online second price auctions, where bids are made sequentially and the winning bidder pays the maximum of the second-highest bid, and a seller specified reserve price. For many such auctions, the seller does not see all the bids or the actual number of bidders and only has access to the current selling price values throughout the course of the auction. We develop a novel non-parametric approach to estimate the underlying consumer valuation distribution based on this data. Previous non-parametric approaches [e.g., George & Hui (2012)] in the literature only use the final selling price and assume knowledge of the total number of bidders. The resulting estimate, in particular, can be used by the seller to compute the optimal profit-maximizing price for the product. Our approach is free of tuning parameters, and we demonstrate its computational and statistical efficiency in a variety of simulation settings, and also on an Xbox 7-day auction dataset on eBay.
