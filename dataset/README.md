- This folder contains the online second price auction dataset of 93 auctions of Xbox game consoles on eBay.
- This dataset is the processed (ready for analysis) version of the corresponding raw dataset collected from "Modeling Online Auctions, Jank & Shmueli, Wiley & sons., 2010" (source: https://www.modelingonlineauctions.com/).
- Each auction in this dataset lasts for 7 days.
- During data analysis, I added a small random noise to all the bids in this data set to avoid equality of bid values from different bidders.
